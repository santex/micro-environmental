{"cursor":"3654","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In ecology, 'productivity' or 'production' refers to the rate of generation of\nbiomass in an ecosystem. It is usually expressed in units of mass per unit\nsurface (or volume) per unit time, for instance grams per square metre per day.\nThe mass unit may relate to dry matter or to the mass of carbon generated.\nProductivity of autotrophs such as plants is called 'primary productivity',\nwhile that of heterotrophs such as animals is called 'secondary\nproductivity'.\n","linknr":564,"url":"Productivity_(ecology)","recorded":1362372551,"links":30,"instances":["ecology","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Aquatic ecology","Biological oceanography","Chemical oceanography"],"headings":["Primary production","Secondary production","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/FoodWeb.jpg/140px-FoodWeb.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg/140px-Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Estuary-mouth.jpg/140px-Estuary-mouth.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Maldivesfish2.jpg/140px-Maldivesfish2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Secondary_succesion_cm01.jpg/40px-Secondary_succesion_cm01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tissue","biology"],["cohort","biology"],["biomass","ecology"]],"members":["biomass","cohort","tissue"],"related":["Ecology","Gram","Day","Dry_matter","Carbon-based_life","Autotroph","Plant","Heterotroph","Animal","Photosynthesis","Sunlight","Sugar","Chemosynthesis","Algae","Bacteria","Cyanobacteria","Biomass","Heterotroph","Trophic_level","Tissue_(biology)","Herbivory","Carnivory","Protist","Fungi","Allen_curve","Cohort_(biology)","Population_dynamics","Biomass_(ecology)","Community_ecology","Trophic_dynamics"]}
