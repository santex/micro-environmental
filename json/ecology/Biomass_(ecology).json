{"cursor":"29596","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\ns, estuaries and coral reefs, can be as productive as forests, generating\nsimilar amounts of new biomass each year on a given area. ]]\n\n'Biomass', in ecology, is the mass of living biological organisms in a given\narea or ecosystem at a given time. Biomass can refer to species biomass, which\nis the mass of one or more species, or to community biomass, which is the mass\nof all species in the community. It can include microorganisms, plants or\nanimals. The mass can be expressed as the average mass per unit area,\nor as the total mass in the community.\n\nHow biomass is measured depends on why it is being measured. Sometimes the\nbiomass is regarded as the natural mass of organisms in situ, just as they\nare. For example, in a salmon fishery, the salmon biomass might be regarded as\nthe total wet weight the salmon would have if they were taken out of the\nwater. In other contexts, biomass can be measured in terms of the dried\norganic mass, so perhaps only 30% of the actual weight might count, the rest\nbeing water. For other purposes, only biological tissues count, and teeth,\nbones and shells are excluded.\n\nIn stricter scientific applications, biomass is measured as the mass of\norganically bound carbon (C) that is present. Apart from bacteria, the total\nlive biomass on earth is about 560 billion tonnes C, and\nthe total annual primary production of biomass is just over 100 billion tonnes\nC/yr. However, the total live biomass of bacteria may\nexceed that of plants and animals.\n","linknr":789,"url":"Biomass_(ecology)","recorded":1362505538,"links":50,"instances":["ecology"],"pdf":["http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/95/12/6578.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/95/12/6578.pdf","http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2458-12-439.pdf","http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2458-12-439.pdf","http://www.iced.ac.uk/documents/Atkinson%20et%20al,%20Deep%20Sea%20Research%20I,%202009.pdf","http://www.iced.ac.uk/documents/Atkinson%20et%20al,%20Deep%20Sea%20Research%20I,%202009.pdf","http://sbsc.wr.usgs.gov/products/pdfs/GarciaPichel_et_al_2003_Estimates_of_global_cyanobacterial.pdf","http://sbsc.wr.usgs.gov/products/pdfs/GarciaPichel_et_al_2003_Estimates_of_global_cyanobacterial.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/content/95/12/6578.full.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/content/95/12/6578.full.pdf","http://www.marietta.edu/~mcshaffd/lead/trophic.pdf"],"categories":["Biology
