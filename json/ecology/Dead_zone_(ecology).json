These occur near\ninhabited coastlines, where aquatic life is most concentrated. (The vast middle\nportions of the oceans, which naturally have little life, are not considered\n\"dead zones\".)\n\nIn March 2004, when the recently established UN Environment Programme published\nits first Global Environment Outlook Year Book (GEO Year Book 2003), it reported\n146 dead zones in the world's oceans where marine life could not be supported\ndue to depleted oxygen levels. Some of these were as small as a square kilometre\n(0.4 miÂ²), but the largest dead zone covered 70,000 square kilometres\n(27,000 miÂ²). A 2008 study counted 405 dead zones worldwide.\n","linknr":649,"url":"Dead_zone_(ecology)","recorded":1362482269,"links":31,"instances":["environmental"],"pdf":["http://www.cees.iupui.edu/Research/Water_Resources/CIWRP/Algae_Information/Presentations/2010-06-17-Symposium/2010-06-17_Lehman-Whole_Lake_Experiments.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/msbasin/pdf/diaz_data.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/msbasin/pdf/diaz_data.pdf","http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2009/pdfs/new%20fact%20sheet%20dead%20zones_final.pdf","http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2009/pdfs/new%20fact%20sheet%20dead%20zones_final.pdf","http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/products/hypox_finalprob.pdf","http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/products/hypox_finalprob.pdf","http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/water/fhp/papers/alum_brochure.pdf","http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/water/fhp/papers/alum_brochure.pdf"],"categories":["Water pollution","Aquatic ecology","Chemical oceanography","Environmental issues with water","Fisheries","Ocean pollution"],"headings":["Causes","Effects","Locations","Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007","Reversal","See also","Notes","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Aquatic_Dead_Zones.jpg/400px-Aquatic_Dead_Zones.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/La-Jolla-Red-Tide.780.jpg/260px-La-Jolla-Red-Tide.780.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/The_affect_of_climate_on_ecological_dead_zones_in_the_Gulf_of_Mexico.jpg/260px-The_affect_of_climate_on_ecological_dead_zones_in_the_Gulf_of_Mexico.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Fishkillk.jpg/220px-Fishkillk.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/35/Dead_Zone_NASA_NOAA.jpg/220px-Dead_Zone_NASA_NOAA.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Estuary-mouth.jpg/140px-Estuary-mouth.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Maldivesfish2.jpg/140px-Maldivesfish2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/3875_aquaimages.jpg/140px-3875_aquaimages.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Yellowfin_tuna_nurp.jpg/140px-Yellowfin_tuna_nurp.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hypoxia","environmental"],["hypoxia","environmental"]],"members":["hypoxia"],"related":["Hypoxia_(environmental)","Oxygen","Ocean","List_of_lakes_by_area","Oceanographer","Coastline","Aquatic_life","UN_Environment_Programme","UN_Environment_Programme","Marine_life","Algae","Algal_bloom","La_Jolla,_San_Diego,_California","Eutrophication","Algal_bloom","Limnologist","David_Schindler","Experimental_Lakes_Area","Anthropogenic","Fertilizer","Fjords","Black_Sea","Sediment","Mississippi_River","Anoxic_waters","Vicksburg,_Mississippi","Mississippi","Gulf_Coast","North_America","Killifish","Southeastern_Louisiana_University","Sex_organ","Hormone","Gene","Protein","Benthos","Chesapeake_Bay","Strait","Kattegat","Baltic_Sea","Black_Sea","Adriatic","South_America","China","Japan","New_Zealand","Oregon_Coast","Louisiana","Texas","Mississippi_River","Nitrogen","Phosphorus","Agribusiness","New_Jersey","Louisiana_Universities_Marine_Consortium","Cocodrie","Hypoxic_zone","Committee_on_Environment_and_Natural_Resources","Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill","Texas","Brazos_River","Energy_Independence_and_Security_Act_of_2007","University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign","Proceedings_of_the_National_Academy_of_Sciences","Mississippi_River_Watershed_Conservation_Programs","Black_Sea","Soviet_Union","Eastern_Europe","Central_Europe","North_Sea","Rhine","Hudson_River","San_Francisco_Bay","Aluminium_sulfate","Algal_bloom","Anoxic_event","Anoxic_waters","Cultural_eutrophication","Eutrophication","Fish_kill","Hypoxia_(environmental)","Marine_pollution","Ocean_deoxygenation","Oxygen_minimum_zone","Shutdown_of_thermohaline_circulation","NOAA"]}
