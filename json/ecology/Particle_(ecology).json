{"cursor":"5655","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn marine and freshwater ecology, a 'particle' is a small object. Particles can\nremain in suspension in the ocean or freshwater, however they eventually settle\n(rate determined by Stokes' law) and accumulate as sediment. Some can enter the\natmosphere through wave action where they can act as cloud condensation nuclei\n(CCN). Many organisms filter particles out of the water with unique filtration\nmechanisms (filter feeders). Particles are often associated with high loads of\ntoxins which attach to the surface. As these toxins are passed up the food\nchain they accumulate in fatty tissue and become increasingly concentrated in\npredators (see bioaccumulation). Very little is known about the dynamics of\nparticles, especially when they are re-suspended by dredging. They can remain\nfloating in the water and drift over long distances. The decomposition of some\nparticles by bacteria consumes a lot of oxygen and can cause the water to\nbecome hypoxic.\n","linknr":350,"url":"Particle_(ecology)","recorded":1362570707,"links":14,"instances":["element","environmental","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Environmental chemistry","Bioindicators"],"headings":["Particle analysis","Contaminant kinetics"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9b/Particlekils.gif/220px-Particlekils.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Krillfilter2kils.jpg/220px-Krillfilter2kils.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Mysis2kils.jpg/220px-Mysis2kils.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Estuary-mouth.jpg/140px-Estuary-mouth.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Maldivesfish2.jpg/140px-Maldivesfish2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["filter","chemistry"],["hypoxia","environmental"],["mercury","element"]],"members":["mercury","hypoxia","filter"],"related":["Ecology","Stokes'_law","Earth's_atmosphere","Cloud_condensation_nuclei","Filter_(chemistry)","Filter_feeder","Toxin","Bioaccumulation","Dredging","Oxygen","Hypoxia_(environmental)","Turbidity","Particle_counter","EcoSCOPE","Micrometers","Harbor","Contaminant","Carcinogenic","Arsenic","Lead","Cadmium","Chromium","Copper","Nickel","Mercury_(element)","Zinc","Anthracene","Fluoranthene","Pyrene","Perylene","Dichloromethane","Chloroform","Carbon_tetrachloride","1,1,1-Trichloroethane","Pentachlorophenol","Pentachlorobenzene","Hexachlorobenzene","Polychlorinated_biphenyl","Benzene","Toluene","Xylene","Polychlorinated_dibenzodioxins","Plankton","Biological_tissue","New_Jersey","Copepod","New_York","Atlantic_City","Mysidae","Krill","Fish","Atlantic_herring","Foodchain","Krill","Filter_setae","Setae","Feeding_basket","Filter_basket","Atlantic_herring","Cod","Flounder","Striped_bass","Filter_feeding"]}
